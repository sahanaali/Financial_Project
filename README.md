## Financial Project: Moving Average Crossover Strategy
This is my financial project, for which I implemented a moving average crossover strategy based on 1000 days of stock and ETF prices. I was given stock and 4 ETF prices of 1000 days. First, I cleaned the data by removing duplicates and filling in missing values. I then applied the moving average crossover strategy, using the 50-day and 200-day moving averages to generate buy (1) and sell (0) signals based on their crossover patterns. A buy signal happens when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term one, suggesting a possible upward trend. On the other hand, a sell signal happens when the short-term average crosses below the long-term one, hinting at a potential downward trend.
